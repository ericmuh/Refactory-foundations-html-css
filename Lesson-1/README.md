# HTML TAGS

In HTML, tags are used to define the structure and layout of a webpage. Each tag has an opening and closing tag, which are used to enclose the content that the tag is applied to.

The opening tag consists of the tag name, wrapped in angle brackets `< >`. For example, the opening tag for a heading would be `<h1>`.

The closing tag is similar to the opening tag, but includes a forward slash / before the tag name. The closing tag for a heading would be `</h1>`.

For example:
`<h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>`
